This script will access the cjdns admin interface to retrieve the 
routing table. It will also download the list of node names 
maintained by ircerr. After some magic to figure out which nodes are 
probably connected it will create a Graphiviz graph of the network.

The labels are cjdns nodes. Some nodes have names, for other nodes 
the last part of their cjdns IPv6 address is shown. Black lines are 
connections between nodes which your node considers active. This 
means it has seen traffic flow over the link. Grey lines are routes 
that are in the routing table and should work but they have not 
(yet) been used.

To use this script, you need:
- a recent version of Python (developed on 2.7)
- the following python modules
 - pydot
 - re
 - socket
 - httplib2
- a running cjdroute with the admin interface enabled
- access to the cjdns network (Hyperboria) to download the list of node
  names

To enable the admin interface in cjdns add the following to your config
(and restart cjdroute):
    "admin":
    {
        // Port to bind the admin TCP server to.
        "bind": "127.0.0.1:11234"
    }
    
You can then run the script like this:
$ ./cjdnsmap.py map.png
map written to map.png

That's it, you've got a map of the network from your own viewpoint.
